# Assignment 6 Model Updates
There were two primary changes made to our model in this assignment. The first change involved
adding the requested TweenModelBuilder interface and implementation to our class to allow it to
integrate well with the AnimationFileReader. By implementing the requested interface, we had an
easy time integrating the animation file reader into our model.

The second major change involved creating a ModelView interface that allowed the view to have access
to a read only version of the model. As part of this implementing this new interface, we exposed a
new method, `getFullState()` which returns the map of AnimatedShapes to the caller. This allows the
model to directly access the state of the model and draw the contained shapes at any time.
